Describe that the literature review consist of two part: ground risk model and path finder.


In this part of the literature review, we will discuss two main concepts: the Ground Risk Model and the Path Finder.
First, we will examine the Ground Risk Model, which involves discussing the concept of probability within a spatial
context. Consider this scenario: if we want to calculate the likelihood of someone being hit by a drone in a specific
location, how do we model this phenomenon? As you can see, scenarios like this are key to understanding the Ground Risk
Model.

Next, we will explore the Path Finder. After identifying a model that answers the question of where a UAV is most likely
to hit someone, we move on to the next question: how do we navigate the UAV or provide the safest route to minimize the
risk of severe casualties? This is why we will discuss the Risk-Based Path Finder.
