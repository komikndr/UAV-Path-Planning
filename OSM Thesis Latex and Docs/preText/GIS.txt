UPX

	UAV Path eXtension, is a library created for creating a flight 
path based on the risk attributes. These attributes can be anything as long as the user
provide the correct location on geographic coordinate system, and the function
that use said attribute.
	UPX geographic backend is provided using OpenStreetMap data to
provides its geographic features and attribute.
	The main building idea of UPX is to aid the safeties of UAV growing
demand in recent years. Where users can select the type of aircrafts that they
are going to use. Start point, end point, and how to calculate the path.
	While UPX intended to be use to aid UAV operation, its library can be
use in manned aircraft. There are 2 main reasons why it choose to be UAV aided
system. First, UPX provide waypoint to be inserted in flight controller,
second and much importantly, Many aircraft operated outside the civiliant
area, hence it is useless to use UPX.

UPX What is Not and Its Limitation
	
What is not.
	UPX is a PRELIMINARY, tools for risk analysis for drone operation 
it do not handle real world phenomena such as sudden wind gale, rain, 
storm. Another aircraft who unfortunately present in the path of the UAV.
	UPX Limitation, while its core function to determine which point 
UAV would be fallen upon. It is computationally expansive to measure each
grid with high degree precision, although it can be combat using montecarlo
procedure. And it is written in Python, while Numba NJit is great method
solution in hindsight, unfortunately Numba do not support DataFarame object.
	How about using GPU? I MEAN YOU WANT ME TO? I NEVER EVEN TOUCH CUDA
or OPENCL, I CAN NOT IMAGINE THE POINTER NIGHTMARE I MUST DEALT WITH.
	While this is not necessarily Astar problem, but since Astar is a path
optimizer sometimes it is plague by not capable to find global minima, just like
its Optimizer brethren.	While it is seldom for Astar to get plague by this
phenomena, since most of the common usage of Astar, road network,
is being constrained by the graph model with mostly acyclic, directed graph 
like a road network.
	And Grid array in UPX, is the opposite of that, nodes with varying 
degree of values, night cylic, and undirected graph. A perfect recipe for
disaster.
	Fortunately it can mostly be, emphised on mostly, to alleviate the
problem by heuristically provide better function to h(n), and there is why
it is called heuristic function. 
	
UPX Parts.	
	UPX, has 3 main parts, preprocessor, postprocessor, and aircraft
dynamics. 

Preprocessor 
	preprocessor is a sub package for handling the geographic data.
Downloading the geographic data, storing it in local storage, and calculating
the value features. Sum, means, max, min. The basic built in attributes are
building footprint density, road area density. User can choose to insert the
additional attribute such as transmission tower, lake, water storage, to name
a few, AS LONG AS IT IS AVAILABLE ON OPERNSTREETMAP


-------------------------------------------------------------------OSM---
OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project that aims to create a free, 
editable map of the world. It was founded in 2004 and has since grown to 
become one of the largest and most popular sources of geospatial data.

OSM is built on the idea that anyone can contribute to the map by adding and updating data. 
Users can add data using GPS devices, aerial imagery, or by manually tracing over satellite imagery. 
The data is then stored in a database and made available under an open license, 
allowing anyone to use and share the data.

OSM data is used in a wide variety of applications, including online maps, routing services, 
and geographic information systems (GIS).It is particularly useful for areas where other 
geospatial data sources may be lacking or out of date.
--------------------------------------------------------------------- GIS
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer-based tools used for
storing, ]manipulating, and visualizing geographic data. They allow users to analyze and 
understand spatial relationships, patterns, and trends in data.

GIS consists of several key components:

-Data: GIS uses data that is linked to a geographic location. This data can be in the form of points, 
lines, or polygons (areas) and can include attributes such as population, land use, or elevation.

-Hardware and software: GIS requires specialized hardware and software to store and analyze the data. 
This includes computers, servers, and specialized software such as ArcGIS or QGIS.

-Maps: GIS allows users to create interactive maps that can be used to visualize and analyze the data. 
Maps can be customized with different layers of information, such as roads, land use, and population density.

-Analysis: GIS allows users to perform spatial analysis on the data, such as calculating the distance 
between two locations or identifying patterns in the data.

GIS is used in a wide range of applications, including environmental planning, transportation, 
public health, and urban planning. It allows users to make informed decisions by 
analyzing and visualizing data in a geographic context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------A STAR
The A* (pronounced "A-star") algorithm is a popular search algorithm that is used to find the 
shortest path between two points in a graph. It is an extension of the well-known 
Dijkstra's algorithm and uses a heuristic function to guide the search.

A heuristic function is a function that estimates the cost of reaching the goal from a given position. 
In the case of the A* algorithm, the heuristic function is used to estimate the 
remaining cost to the goal from the current position. This helps the algorithm to focus its search on the most 
promising paths and avoid exploring paths that are unlikely to lead to the goal.

The A* algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of unexplored paths. 
At each step, it selects the path with the lowest cost (as determined by the heuristic function) 
and expands it to explore its neighboring vertices. If the goal is reached, the algorithm terminates 
and returns the shortest path. If the goal is not reached, the algorithm continues to search until it has explored all possible paths.

The A* algorithm is widely used in computer science and has a number of important applications, 
including in video games, robotics, and geographic information systems. It is known for its 
efficiency and ability to find the optimal solution in many cases.
