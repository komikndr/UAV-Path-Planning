Describe that the literature review consist of two part: ground risk model and path finder.


In this part of the literature review, we will discuss two main concepts: the Ground Risk Model and the Path Finder.
First, we will examine the Ground Risk Model, which involves discussing the concept of probability within a spatial
context. Consider this scenario: if we want to calculate the likelihood of someone being hit by a drone in a specific
location, how do we model this phenomenon? As you can see, scenarios like this are key to understanding the Ground Risk
Model.

Next, we will explore the Path Finder. After identifying a model that answers the question of where a UAV is most likely
to hit someone, we move on to the next question: how do we navigate the UAV or provide the safest route to minimize the
risk of severe casualties? This is why we will discuss the Risk-Based Path Finder.



=========================================================================

We found a total of 22 different research papers that contributed to our study on ground risk models. Various approaches
have been taken to develop ground risk models for UAVs. One approach is the use of scenario-based methods, as discussed
in the research of \cite{ancel_real-time_2017}, which involves the development of detailed scenarios that describe
potential UAV operations and the associated risks.

To clarify further, in the research done by \cite{ancel_real-time_2017}, there are two common methods for describing the
severity of accidents using scenario-based approaches. These scenarios are typically coupled with safety and hazard
levels on a per-operation basis. The first method utilizes a lookup table to determine the severity of an accident. The
second method represents the scenario as a directed acyclic graph, a type of tree graph, where we start at the root node
and traverse based on yes/no questions. These questions can range from simple ones, such as whether the UAV hit a
person, to more detailed ones, such as whether the accident caused harm.

This method is computed using techniques such as risk tree diagrams, Bayesian belief networks
\cite{ancel_real-time_2017}, and hazard risk assessment matrices \cite{barr_preliminary_2017}. Although these methods
might produce different analyses, they generally describe the same phenomena.

From the description above, it appears that scenario-based models do not suit our needs for a spatially based ground
risk model. Essentially, they reduce to questions of general progression from the point of impact to the accident caused
by the drone. They provide no information on how the position of the UAV affects the casualty risk of failed operations
and only serve as a preliminary assessment.

To add a spatial component to our models, we can simply incorporate location information into the yes/no question tree
graph. What I mean by this is to propose an idea where, in a certain area, if a UAV somehow falls, does it cause harm,
and based on the surrounding environment, does that harm result in fatality?

This brings us to the most widely used method, the use of ground probabilistic risk assessment methods, which involve
the quantification of risks per area using probability and consequence metrics. Although a greater number of research
papers use this method, as compiled by \cite{washington_review_2017}, our concept is derived from the prime example of
this research conducted by \cite{primatesta_ground_2020}.


=========================================================================

A ground risk model for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) typically consists of
several subcomponents that are used to assess the various factors that can impact
the safety and effectiveness of UAV operations. The components in ground risk model
are failure model, impact location model, recovery model, stress model, exposure
model, incident stress model, and harm model, as shown as in Figure 2.1. based on the study
of \cite{prima} 



However, this approach is not new,
since many earlier researches already follow a guideline to model these components.
Breunig et al., 2018 provide general guideline for the model, while Washington et al.,
2017 provide a detailed description for the model. Washington et al., 2017 method
of compilation is based on Pat-Cornell, 1996, which studied the level of analytical
detail when modeling the risk formulation.
