Chapter 1, Introduction

Introduction

	Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, UAV, also known as drone, is getting more 
recognition in recent year. A booming of UAV is caused by the compononent 
needed to manufacture the drone, especially microcontroller is getting 
cheaper, and smaller. Compare to previous drone iteration , drone nowadays 
offers much wider capability, such as enhance range, ability to 
mounted hardware, camera for example, and of course easily deploable without 
requiring many technician to maintain.
	UAV often being used in the area where it is dangerous, impractical,
and expensive for human. Affordable entry point of using drone, 
incentivied emerging industry to exploit capability that UAV offers.
Not only that, but the existing industry also get intersted to use uav as 
augmentation to its existing operation infrastructure. And that industries are, 
logistic company, agricultural company, multimedia company, 
and surveyor to name a few
	Alas, UAV regulation is in unfortunate dichotomy, these are UAV
regulation are very conservative in nature to the point of limiting the
capability of the UAV itself, [insert FAA part number here]. While often time in
many areas UAV usage is very lenient to non existance.
	That is why, this paper, are try to explore the possibilities of
creating a safety tools to help the users to create an optimized safe flight
path to navigate. 

Research Purpose

	The UAV path planning research has purpose to discover the usability
of geoanalysis and aircraft dynamic to determine the safe possible route.

Research Limitation

	- The UAV path planner only provide data based on static data, this
	  include the building footprint, road foorprint, and population
	  density to name a few, while dynamic data such as real time wind and
	  wheather data is ignored.
	- UAV path planner only provide the flight path coordinate, and do not
	  provide a method to handle real life incident.

 Chapter 2, Literature Review

Theoritical frame works

Drone and drone types
	Unmanned aerial vehicle is one of the types of aircraft that does not
required to have human present onboard. Just like its manned counterpart, UAV
has its own propulsion system, lift devices, cargo area, power source and its
flight control. 
	Drone can be categorized by its autonomy, from fully manual to fully
autonomous. Fully manual UAV relies every of its control to human operator.
Fully manual also very cheap to manufactur, while also being the most
dangerous type, since it has little to no safety features. While the oposite
are true for the later.
	Usually many drone are fell into semi-autonomous category, where pilot
can send direction control and its onboard devices. While the UAV itself provide 
flight assistance[insert reference for acro, level], object avoidance, return
to home, and failsafe mechanism.
	From its propulsion and lift generation method. UAV can generally be
divided into fixed wing, and multirotor. Fixed wing generally shaped with
fuselage with placement combination of wing pairs. While multirotor relays on
its vertical oriented propeller both as propulsion and lift generation. With
the number of propeller that it can safely flight with from 3, 4 and its
multiplicity of 2. 
	The shape of UAV has great influence to how its fell, with fixed wing
generally hlode down. While multirotor fell following the ballistic
trajectory. Both of which will influenced the fall probability heat map.
	
Graph Theory. (SIMPLE)[WARNING PLEASE DO RE-RESEARCH]
	Graph theory is one the discipline in mathemathics where the use of
graph in simple term can be describe as a relationship between its element.
Graph component are consist of vertex or node (V) and edge or link (E). Node
is the object being represented in graph, while the edge describe
relationship between the nodes.
	Graph theory can be use to describe real life phenomenon. Social
interaction can be desribe using a graph. Where people is nodes and the edge
is relation between them. 
	Edge can have a function attached to them. Some function is use to
describe the relationship between nodes, also called weight function. This
function, can be any function. For example in social interaction an edge can
be augmented to basic linear function [xb+z] where x is the node(person), b is
weight, and z is bias. this function can describe how storng the relationship
between each person.

Path finder.
	Pathfinder is sub topic of graph thoery, where its purpose is to find
which node and which edge that connecting the starting node to its final node.
There are 2 type of pathfinder algorithm. informed and Uninformed pathfinder.
Informed path finder are path finder that knows the location of its final node
while the opposite is true for the later. Informed search use heuristical
function to estimately guessing the suitable node to traverse to. Example of
informed search is Astar, A*, algorithm
