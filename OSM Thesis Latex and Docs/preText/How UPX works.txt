UAV Pathfinder eXtension

	UAV Pathfinder eXtension, UPX, is both python libraries and
application to find the optimal risk informed flight path. The risk metioned
previously is a set of rules to determine the probability of fatality in case
the UAV happen to be malfunctioned and fell in that area. UPX is built based
on the concern of negative consequence of increase frequency of UAV flown in
urban area.
	 UPX is written in python and use the python GIS, graph, and numerical
processing in python. In broad outline, UPX works as follows.

	[GEO Retrieving Library]->[Assigning Value]->[Pathfinding]

Subsec
	Geoprocessing in UPX is built upon geopandas, OSMnx, and Tesspy.

[To be included]
- Geoprocessing in UOX is handled by geopandas, and OSMNx, to retrieve, store
  and process the based map for next step.
- Base map is not yet discretized, UPX need a discretized map to work
  properly, since path finder only works on graph, where the node is a
discretized section of the map.
- UPX discretizdes the map using Tesspy library to create a 2D grid structure.
- Each of this grid cell still contain cut polygon shape.
- If the features exist in cell, even though it is cut, it still counted. Then
  we can convert the cut polygon into point, where each point can be
aggragated into value for each cell.
- then we
