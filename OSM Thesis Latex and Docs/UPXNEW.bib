	abstract = {Increasing use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ({UAV}) in urban environments poses to an increased risk of fallen {UAVs} impacting people and vehicles on the ground, as well as colliding with manned aircraft in the vicinity of airports. Risk management of {UAV} ﬂights for safe operations is essential. We proposed a comprehensive risk assessment model for {UAV} operation in urban environments. Three risk categories (people, vehicles, and manned aircraft) were considered and each risk cost was quantiﬁed using collision probability. We adjusted the risk costs in various magnitudes to a same scale and conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the optimal coefﬁcients of the three risk cost models. We then computed the total risk and generated a risk cost map for path planning. Modiﬁed path planning algorithms were used to produce a cost-effective path, and we compared their performances in terms of total risk cost and computational time. Lastly, we performed simulations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed risk assessment model. The results show that the risk-cost-based path planning method can generate safer path for {UAV} operations than the traditional shortest-distance-based method. Our proposed model can be extended to complex urban environments by including more relevant parameters and data.},

	abstract = {To integrate unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) into the national airspace in a safe manner, a risk-based approach to the regulation of {UAVs} is adopted in many countries. Thus, the capacity to permit {UAVs} in urban airspace also needs to be evaluated in a risk-based sense. In this regard, this paper proposes a methodology to analyze the capacity of {UAV} corridors on the basis of third-party risk on the ground. By linking the collision rate of the corridor and the failure rates of {UAVs} with the number of fatalities on the ground, the capacity of the {UAV} corridor is derived to satisfy the target level of safety. To model the collision rate of {UAVs} in the corridor, the Reich collision risk model is utilized. Moreover, a ground risk map is generated to compute the third-party risk on the ground using the databases for Seoul, Korea. The results show that the failure rate of {UAVs} is the dominant factor for determining the capacity of the corridor, even if the number of corridors increases. The proposed methodology could be useful to manage the number of ﬂights for applications where the {UAV} corridor is ﬁxed and ﬂight continues, such as package delivery.},

However, the rapid development of unmanned aircraft technology means that the range of commercial and scientiﬁc applications is growing equally rapid. At the same time the trend in national and international regulations for unmanned aircraft is to take a risk-based approach, effectively requiring risk assessment for every ﬂight operation. This work addresses the growing need for methods for quantitatively evaluating individual ﬂights by modelling the consequences of a ballistic descent of an unmanned aircraft as a result of a major in-ﬂight incident. The presented model is a probability density function for the ground impact area based on a second order drag model with probabilistic assumptions on the least well-known parameters of the ﬂight, and includes the effect of wind. The model has low computational complexity and is well-suited for high ﬁdelity simulations for longer ﬂights over populated areas and with changing trajectory parameters.},

	abstract = {There is much effort being directed towards the development of safety regulations for unmanned aircraft systems ({UAS}). National airworthiness authorities have advocated the adoption of a risk-based approach, whereby regulations are driven by the outcomes of a systematic process to assess and manage identiﬁed safety risks. Subsequently, models characterising the primary hazards associated with {UAS} operations have now become critical to the development of regulations and in turn, to the future of the industry. Key to the development of airworthiness regulations for {UAS} is a comprehensive understanding of the risks {UAS} operations pose to people and property on the ground. A comprehensive review of the literature identiﬁed 33 different models (and component sub models) used to estimate ground risk posed by {UAS}. These models comprise failure, impact location, recovery, stress, exposure, incident stress and harm sub-models. The underlying assumptions and treatment of uncertainties in each of these sub-models differ signiﬁcantly between models, which can have a signiﬁcant impact on the development of regulations. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in research into {UAS} ground risk modelling, discusses how the various sub-models relate to the different components of the regulation, and explores how model-uncertainties potentially impact the development of regulations for {UAS}.},

	abstract = {Schiphol, the main airport of the Netherlands, is growing rapidly. The aircraft movements, also growing in number, place a considerable environmental burden on the surrounding population, notably, noise and odour nuisance and risks. In the process of deciding on how to extend the capacity of the airport to accommodate the anticipated twofold growth in the number of movements with respect to 1990, environmental problems form a major concern. The concern about risks for the surrounding population was enhanced after the crash on 4 October 1992, in which a Boeing 747 cargo carrier bored into a block of flats in a suburb of Amsterdam near Schiphol. In this accident, the four crew members were killed, together with 39 inhabitants of the flatsrapartment building. These risks were studied as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment Ž{EIA}.. To make these studies useful for decision making necessitated a major improvement in the available techniques for risk quantification. The results of the quantitative analyses, using several different methods, have all indicated that the activities of Schiphol pose a considerable risk compared to other major industrial activities in the Netherlands. This paper describes the development of the methodology from 1990 in the light of the policy context in which it took place. Use of the methods in the decision-making process is illustrated by describing the current status of this process. q 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

An important part of such an assessment is to identify the risk of fatalities, preferably in a quantitative way since this allows for comparison with manned aviation to determine whether an equivalent level of safety is achievable. This work presents a method for quantifying the probability of fatalities resulting from an uncontrolled descent of an unmanned aircraft conducting a {BVLOS} flight. The method is based on a standard stochastic model, and employs a parameterized high fidelity ground impact distribution model that accounts for both aircraft specifications, parameter uncertainties, and wind. The method also samples the flight path to create an almost continuous quantification of the risk as a function of mission flight time. The methodology is exemplified with a 180 km flight in Danish airspace with a Penguin C aircraft.},

It is a two-dimensional location-based map that quantifies the risk to the population on ground of flight operations over a specified area. The risk map is generated through a probabilistic approach and combines several layers, including population density, sheltering factor, no-fly zones, and obstacles. Each element of the risk map has associated a risk value that quantifies the risk of flying over a specific location. Risk values are defined by a risk assessment process using different uncontrolled descent events, drone parameters, environmental characteristics, as well as uncertainties on parameters. The risk map is able to quantify the risk of large areas, such as urban environments, and allows for easy identification of high and low-risk locations. The map is a tool for informed decision making, and our results report some examples of risk map with different aircraft in a realistic urban environment.},

After that, two tests were carried out to evaluate the performance of {GPS} absolute velocity determination in the case of a static and an airborne {GPS} receiver and {INS} (Inertial Navigation System) instrument in kinematic mode. In static mode, the receiver velocity has been estimated to be several mm/s with the carrier-phase derived Doppler measurements, and several cm/s with the receiver generated Doppler measurements. In kinematic mode, {GPS} absolute velocity estimates are compared with the synchronized measurements from the high accuracy {INS}.

	abstract = {In the first part of this series of papers an outline was given of the approach made at the Royal Aircraft Establishment to the problems of estimating collision risk and of specifying the quality of navigation needed to make separation standards safe. It was stressed that estimates should be based on intensive observation of flying errors, rather than on speculative theories, and that it is more feasible to develop ‘upper limit’ estimating techniques than those which purport to give the exact risk. In summary, a list of seven ‘requirements’ was given, as a reminder of the essential principles which can so easily be overlooked in the piecemeal task of relating separation standards to collision risk.
            
              The purpose of this paper is to show some of the theoretical techniques which have been developed at R.A.E. to satisfy five of these requirements. (The remaining two do not call for special techniques and will be dealt with when practical applications are described in Part {III}.) The paper contains three Appendixes, dealing with the frequency of losing separation in one dimension, the computation of
              P
              's from the assumed tail shapes, and the treatment of relative errors. These are not included here but will appear in the off-printed version which may be obtained from the Royal Aircraft Establishment.

	abstract = {This paper proposes an effective approach for modelling and assessing the risks associated with unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) integrated into national airspace system ({NAS}). Two critical hazards with {UAV} operations are considered and analyzed, which are ground impacts and midair collisions. Threats to fatalities that result from the two hazards are the focus in the proposed method. In order to realize ground impact assessment, a multifactor risk model is designed by calculating system reliability required to meet a target level of safety for different {UAV} categories. Both fixed-wing and rotary-wing {UAVs} are taken into account under a real scenario that is further partitioned into different zones to make the evaluation more precise. Official territory and population data of the operation scenario are incorporated, as well as {UAV} self-properties. Casualty area of impacting debris can be obtained as well as the probability of fatal injuries on the ground. Sheltering factors are not neglected and defined as four types based on the real scenario. When midair collision fatality risk is estimated, a model of aircraft collisions based on the density of civil flight in different regions over Chinese airspace is proposed. In the model, a relative collision area and flying speed between {UAVs} and manned aircraft are constructed to calculate expected frequency of fatalities for each province correspondingly. Truthful data with different numbers of {UAVs} is incorporated in the model with the expected number of fatalities after a collision is included. Experimental simulations are made to evaluate the ground impacts and midair collisions when {UAVs} operate in the {NAS}.},

	title = {The Development of Ground Impact Models for the Analysis of the Risks Associated with Unmanned Aircraft Operations Over Inhabited Areas},
	abstract = {With the emergence of Unmanned Aircraft Systems ({UAS}) there is a growing need for safety standards and regulatory frameworks to manage the risks associated with their operations. The primary driver for airworthiness regulations (i.e., those governing the design, manufacture, maintenance and operation of {UAS}) are the risks presented to people in the regions overflown by the aircraft. Models characterising the nature of these risks are needed to inform the development of airworthiness regulations. The output from these models should include measures of the collective, individual and societal risk. A brief review of these measures is provided. Based on the review, it was determined that the model of the operation of an {UAS} over inhabited areas must be capable of describing the distribution of possible impact locations, given a failure at a particular point in the flight plan. Existing models either do not take the impact distribution into consideration, or propose complex and computationally expensive methods for its calculation. A computationally efficient approach for estimating the boundary (and in turn area) of the impact distribution for fixed wing unmanned aircraft is proposed. A series of geometric templates that approximate the impact distributions are derived using an empirical analysis of the results obtained from a 6Degree of Freedom (6DoF) simulation. The impact distributions can be aggregated to provide impact footprint distributions for a range of generic phases of flight and missions. The maximum impact footprint areas obtained from the geometric template are shown to have a relative error of typically less than 1\% compared to the areas calculated using the computationally more expensive 6DoF simulation. Computation times for the geometric models are on the order of one second or less, using a standard desktop computer. Future work includes characterising the distribution of impact locations within the footprint boundaries.},

	abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey ( {NHAPS} ), a 2 - year probability - based telephone survey ( n = 9386 ) of exposure - related human activities in the United States ( U.S. ) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( {EPA} ). The primary purpose of {NHAPS} was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. {NHAPS} was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer - assisted telephone interview instrument ( {CATI} ) to collect 24 - h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure - related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day ( i.e., each microenvironment ). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 {EPA} regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. {NHAPS} respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board ( {CARB} ) sponsored a state - wide activity pattern study, and the mid - 1990s, when {NHAPS} was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ( {ETS} ) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to {ETS} was reported to take place in residential locations.

	abstract = {Significance
            Knowing where people are is critical for accurate impact assessments and intervention planning, particularly those focused on population health, food security, climate change, conflicts, and natural disasters. This study demonstrates how data collected by mobile phone network operators can cost-effectively provide accurate and detailed maps of population distribution over national scales and any time period while guaranteeing phone users’ privacy. The methods outlined may be applied to estimate human population densities in low-income countries where data on population distributions may be scarce, outdated, and unreliable, or to estimate temporal variations in population density. The work highlights how facilitating access to anonymized mobile phone data might enable fast and cheap production of population maps in emergency and data-scarce situations.
          , 
            During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones ({MPs}) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of {MP} calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of {MP} data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion {MP} call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of {MP} users. With similar data being collected every day by {MP} network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

These regulations often require that the {RPAS} operators perform a risk analysis to assess the level of risk of the operations. The paper considers the Italian regulation and describes the implementation of the {RPAS} risk analysis method proposed by {ENAC} into a 2D flight path planning software for {UAV} that is called {JavaCube}. This tool is able to generate waypoint-based paths based on graph search algorithms which incorporate the risk analysis model within their cost function so that the risk for the aircraft of occurring in catastrophic failure is minimized. The resulting paths are shown on a risk map that is generated according to {UAV} data, flight altitude and the population density distribution of the overflown area. This tool could provide a useful {UAV} path planner that meets the requirements of the current Italian regulation.},

	abstract = {Today, large-volume mobile phone call datasets are widely applied to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of human urban activity. This paper discusses several fundamental issues in estimating population distributions based on mobile call data. By adopting an individual-based call activity dataset that consists of nearly two million mobile subscribers who made over one hundred million communications over seven consecutive days, we explore the relationships among the Erlang values, the number of calls, and the number of active mobile subscribers. Then, the {LandScan} population density dataset is introduced to evaluate the process of estimating the population. The empirical ﬁndings indicate that: (1) Temporal variation exists in the relation between the Erlang values and the number of calls; (2) The number of calls is linearly proportional to the number of active mobile subscribers; (3) The proportion between the mobile subscribers and the actual total population varies in different areas, thus failing to represent the underlying population. Hence, the call activity reﬂects “activity intensity” rather than population distribution. The Erlang is a defective indicator of population distribution, whereas the number of calls serves as a better measure. This research provides an explicit clariﬁcation with respect to using call activity data for estimating population distribution.},

	abstract = {In the last years, the Flight Mechanics Research Group of Politecnico di Torino started a wide research activity, focused on exploration and implementation of path planning algorithms for commercial autopilots, typically adopted on unmanned vehicles. Different path planning approaches were implemented in a Matlab/Simulink based tool, generating waypoints sequences with four methods: geometric predefined trajectories, manual waypoints definition, automatic waypoints distribution (i.e. optimizing camera payload capabilities) and, finally, a comprehensive A*-based approach. The tool was also integrated with functions managing the maps used for planning. In this paper, two approaches to path planning in presence of orographic obstacles are detailed. The first algorithm is subdivided in three phases: the generation of a risk map associated with the ground orography, the transformation of the map in a digraph analyzed with the A* algorithm (to obtain the path with minimum risk/minimum distance) and finally the smoothing phase, to obtain a flyable waypoint sequence, realized with the Dubins curves. The structure of this method was defined and implemented, but its optimization is still in progress. The second algorithm is based on the same risk map, but optimizing polynomial curves with a genetic algorithm. This method produces a flyable waypoints sequence, minimizing a cost function reflecting path length and collision risk. An extension of this path solver, including aircraft performance constraints, was also considered.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a risk-aware path planning strategy for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in urban environments. The aim is to compute an effective path that minimizes the risk to the population, thus enforcing safety of flight operations over inhabited areas. To quantify the risk, the proposed approach uses a risk-map that associates discretized locations of the space with a suitable risk-cost. Path planning is performed in two phases: first, a tentative path is computed off-line on the basis on the information related to static risk factors; then, using a dynamic risk-map, an on-line path planning adjusts and adapts the offline path to dynamically arising conditions. Off-line path planning is performed using {riskA}*, an ad-hoc variant of the A* algorithm, which aims at minimizing the risk. While off-line path planning has no stringent time constraints for its execution, this is not the case for the on-line phase, where a fast response constitutes a critical design parameter. We propose a novel algorithm called Borderland, which uses the check and repair approach to rapidly identify and adjust only the portion of path involved by the inception of relevant dynamical changes in the risk factor. After the path planning, a smoothing process is performed using Dubins curves. Simulation results confirm the suitability of the proposed approach.},

Small unmanned aircraft injury potential correlates to the impact kinetic energy and characteristic diameter of its part that contacts the body. The injury severity of small unmanned aircraft can be less than serious in impacts at minimal airspeed that contact the body with their sufficiently blunt part; however, they are capable of inflicting lethal injury, even when impacting at minimal airspeed, if they impact the body with their sharper part. Consequently, for injury minimization the small unmanned aircraft basic operational and physical design criteria are described regarding impact velocity and attitude upon impact, along with the shape of the airframe part that contacts the body.},

	abstract = {Not every unmanned aircraft system ({UAS}) poses the same level of risk. Intuitively, the smaller and lighter the {UAS}, the less risk it poses. Regulators are increasingly finding the need to declare a certain category of small unmanned aircraft systems ({UAS}) to be “lowest-risk” or relatively “harmless.” This categorization allows them to set aside the devices that require the simplest regulation while maintaining an acceptable level of safety, and focus rulemaking and technical effort on the higher-risk {UAS}. An early and hurried effort to define such a category in regulation, by the United States Federal Aviation Administration Registration Task Force (“{RTF}”), has seemingly unintentionally influenced other jurisdictions to follow suit in a broader fashion without close analysis of the underlying analysis or assumptions. We show that the method of estimating the safety of a {UAS} used in initial estimates proposed by the {RTF} reveals that safety is dominated almost entirely by factors unrelated to the physical characteristics of the {UAS}, such as pilot skill and exposed population. We further show that current academic and regulatory predictions of injury based on {UAS} kinetic energy and relied upon by the {RTF} are unrealistically conservative. The combination of these factors reveals that the {RTF} was overly conservative in its selection of a 250 gram weight threshold, given the framework it chose to define the category, and that this weight limit was likely too low by an order of magnitude. A more realistic upper threshold for a lowest-risk mass-based category of {UAS} is found around the 2 kilogram range.},

	abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey ( {NHAPS} ), a 2 - year probability - based telephone survey ( n = 9386 ) of exposure - related human activities in the United States ( U.S. ) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( {EPA} ). The primary purpose of {NHAPS} was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. {NHAPS} was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer - assisted telephone interview instrument ( {CATI} ) to collect 24 - h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure - related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day ( i.e., each microenvironment ). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 {EPA} regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63\% of the households contacted. {NHAPS} respondents reported spending an average of 87\% of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6\% of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board ( {CARB} ) sponsored a state - wide activity pattern study, and the mid - 1990s, when {NHAPS} was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke ( {ETS} ) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to {ETS} was reported to take place in residential locations.

	abstract = {This report is a collection of studies performed at Sandia National Laboratories in support of Phase One (inert debris) for the Risk and Lethality Commonality Team. This team was created by the Range Safety Group of the Range Commander`s Council to evaluate the safety issues for debris generated during flight tests and to develop debris safety criteria that can be adopted by the national ranges. Physiological data on the effects of debris impacts on people are presented. Log-normal curves are developed to relate the impact kinetic energy of fragments to the probability of fatality for people exposed in standing, sitting, or prone positions. Debris hazards to aircraft resulting from engine ingestion or penetration of a structure or windshield are discussed. The smallest mass fragments of aluminum, steel, and tungsten that may be hazardous to current aircraft are defined. Fragment penetration of the deck of a small ship or a pleasure craft is also considered. The smallest mass fragments of aluminum, steel, or tungsten that can penetrate decks are calculated.},
