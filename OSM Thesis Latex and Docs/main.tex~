   \chapter{Introduction}

        \section{Introduction}
                Unmanned Aerial vehicles, UAVs, also known as a drone, is getting more 
	        recognition in recent years. The booming of UAVs is caused by the component needed to manufacture the drone, especially
	        microcontrollers getting cheaper, and smaller. Compare to previous drone iteration, drone nowadays offers much wider
	        capability, such as enhanced range, the ability to mount hardware, and camera for example, and of course easily
	        deployable without requiring many technicians to maintain them.


		        UAVs are often being used in area where it is dangerous, impractical,
	        and expensive for human. The affordable entry point of using a drone incentivized emerging industries to exploit the
	        capability that UAVs offer. Not only that but the existing industry is also getting interested to use UAVs as an
	        augmentation to its existing operational infrastructure. And that industries are, logistics companies, agricultural
	        companies, multimedia companies, and surveyors to name a few


		        Alas, UAV regulation is in an unfortunate dichotomy, these are UAV
	        regulations are very conservative to the point of limiting the capability of the UAV itself, [insert FAA part number
	        here]. While often time in many areas UAV usage is very lenient to nonexistent. 

            
		        That is why, this paper, is trying to explore the possibilities of
	        creating safety tools to help the users to create an optimized safe flight path to navigate.

        \section{Research purpose}
		        The UAV path planning research has the purpose to discover the usability of geoanalysis and aircraft, dynamic
            to determine the safe possible route.

        \section{Research Limitation}
        \begin{myitemize}   
            \item   The UAV path planner only provides data based on static data, this includes the building footprint,
                    road footprint, and population density to name a few, while dynamic data such as real-time wind and
                    whether data is ignored.
            \item   UAV path planners only provide the flight path coordinate and do not provide a method to handle
                    real-life in
        \end{myitemize}

    \chapter{Background Theory and Methodology}

        \section{Drone and drone types}
            An unmanned aerial vehicle is one of the types of aircraft that does not require have human present onboard. Just
            like its manned counterpart, UAV has its own propulsion system, lift devices, cargo area, power source, and flight
            control. 


                The drone can be categorized by its autonomy, from fully manual to fully autonomous. Fully manual UAVs rely on every
            of its control by a human operator. Fully manual is also very cheap to manufacture, while also being the most
            dangerous type, since it has little to no safety features. While the opposite is true for the latter.
                Usually, many drones is fell into the semi-autonomous category, where a pilot can send direction control and its
            onboard devices. While the UAV itself provides flight assistance[insert reference for acro, level], object
            avoidance, return to home, and failsafe mechanism.


                From its propulsion and lift generation method. UAVs can generally be divided into fixed-wing, and multirotor. Fixed
            wings are generally shaped with fuselage with a placement combination of wing pairs. While multirotor relies on its
            vertically oriented propeller both as propulsion and lift generation. With the number of propellers that it can
            safely fly with from 3 to 4 and its multiplicity of 2. 


                The shape of a UAV has a great influence on how it falls, with fixed wings, generally glides down. While the
            multirotor fell following the ballistic trajectory. Both of which will influence the falling probability
            heat map.    
            
        \section{Graph theory} %DO RERESEARCH
            Graph theory is one of the disciplines in mathematics where the use of
            graphs in simple terms can be described as a relationship between its elements. Graph components consist of vertex or
            node (V) and edge or link (E). The node is the object being represented in the graph, while the edge describes the
            relationship between the nodes.
        
            
                Graph theory can be used to describe the real-life phenomenon. Social interaction can be described using a graph.
            Where people are nodes and the edge is the relation between them.
        
                Edge can have a function attached to them. Some function is used to
            describe the relationship between nodes, also called weight function. This function can be any function. For example in
            social interaction an edge can be augmented to a basic linear function [xb+z] where x is the node(person), b is weight,
            and z is bias. This function can describe how strong the relationship between each person is.

	    \subsection{Pathfinder}
      
        \section{Pathfinder} %DO RERESEARCH
            Pathfinder is a sub-topic of graph theory, where its purpose is to find
            which node and which edge that connecting the starting node to its final node. There are 2 types of pathfinder
            algorithms. Informed and Uninformed pathfinder. An informed pathfinder is a pathfinder that knows the location of its
            final node while the opposite is true for the latter. The informed search uses a heuristical
        

                Function to estimate guessing the suitable node to traverse to. 
            An example of informed search is Astar, A*, algorithm. Its search function can be written as [f(n) = g(n) + h(n)] where
            f(n) is the cost of each node, g(n) is the cost proportional based on the distance between nodes and its starting node,
            h(n), heuristic function, is the cost based on the distance between nodes and their final nodes.

	\section{Python and packages}
		
		\subsection{Python}
			Python is an interpreted programming language. Interpreted language has a benefit to be an easier language compare
		to compiled language. Added to this, it has massive scientific related packages and libaries. Combine with quick deployment
		and its STEM library, it is a perfect choice for engineering, mathematic, and physic analysis. Based on previous criteria
		it is a great choice for creating UAV path planner application and library.
			While python indeed have a great advantage, unfortunately its comparatively easy language came with a great price.
		Interpreted language is inherently slow, 8 to 100 time slower compare to C/C++ language. Base python language also cannot
		use more than one thread because its GIL, Global Interpreted Lock, prevent the threads to share memories. Fortunately, 
		most of heavy calculation is handled by c/c++ library, where python use caller function to launch the libraries.
			
		\subsection{Geopandas}
			Geopandas is a libary built for measuring geographical-spatial analysis in python. It is one the must have package
		when working with geo-spatial data. Geopandas itself can be regarded as the extention of Pandas libary, where Pandas is
		tabular data processor akin to Microsoft Excel. Geopands has spatial related function such as overlay, spatial join, clipping
		to group, aggregate, and measure geospatial data.

		\subsection{Shapely}
			Shapely is a geomeytry calculation and manipulation packages available for python. Many of geospatial function in 
		geopandas relies on shapely itself. Overlay, clipping, spatial binary combination of geopandas can be found in Shapely.
		In this paper shapely is being use to create custom filter for heat map function of aircraft falling probability.

		\subsection{Tesspy}
			Tesspy, a tesselation library for python. It purpose, as the name implied is for creating a tesselated polygon.
		Tesspy can be use as long as the polygon object is derived from shapely object. Tesspy offer type of tesselated map 
		that commonly use for geopastial processing. Sqare grid, hexbin, voronoi city block, and addaptive square is the type
		of tesselated maps to name a few. 

		\subsection{OSMNx}
			OSMNx is a combintaion of OSM and networkx. OSMNx mainly is being use to create graph representation of road 
		network. It use the geopandas dataframe, to build the network, as long as the roads in question is connected at least
		with another road. But for this paper, OSMNx only being used as a geocoder and reverse geocoder to retrieve geopandas
		data.

		\subsection{NetworkX}
			To create a graph structure NetworkX provide the necessary function to do that. NetworkX offers graph creation,
		graph traversal algorithms, and graph manipulation. The graph as previously mentioned in the combination of nodes and edges.
		The A star pathfinder for the UAV Path finder also using the NetworkX built in Astar.

		\subsection{Libpysal}
			Although NetworkX provided us with the method to manipulate graph. However it does not have a method to connect nodes
		to its surrounding neighbours. Libpysal provide us with queen, rook, and fuzzy contiguity to connect the node.
